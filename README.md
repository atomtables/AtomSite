# AtomSite (My personal portfolio)

This is all the code to my personal portfolio website. I've been dragging
my feet on this website for the better part of 3 years, getting nowhere each time.
This website is special, as its one of the first projects I've ever done that I'm
really publishing to be out there.

The entire website was designed to be mobile, tablet, and desktop friendly. It uses
a lot of JavaScript, but my plan is to eventually bring compatibility down to
my Windows Phone with Internet Explorer 11. The compatibility's just there for the
fun and learning the different methods used to backport incompatible features.

It was a lot of frustration trying to get the CSS working all properly. I used 
TailwindCSS so it was a lot of work to find exactly where I added all the padding
or stuff like that. It turned out pretty decent in the end, so enjoy!
