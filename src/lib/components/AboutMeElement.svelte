        I'm <b>Adithiya Venkatakrishnan</b>, but I go with friends as Venky and online as
        atomtables.
        <br><br>
        I'm a <b>high school sophomore</b> who's passionate about the world of <b>software
        development, cybersecurity, and general computer science</b>. Check out my projects
        below!
        <br><br>
        I've been coding since I was about seven years old, and my main interests lie in
        <b>mobile app development, web development, and low-level programming</b>.
        <br><br>
        <b>I like music a lot</b>, and I sing and play the piano (<b>I'm working on some
        stuff
        right
        now</b>).
        <br><br>
        I go to <b>Edison Academy Magnet School</b>, and I'm on the Computer Science Club
        Council
        there. I also write articles for the Eagle Eye and the school newspaper, especially
        for the Tech topics.
